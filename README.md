# irl-subs - Live subtitles for Oculus Rift

**irl-subs** is an augmented reality app for Oculus Rift which overlays live subtitles
over a projected video stream.  The input audio is processed and sent to a speech-to-text
API and optionally a text translation API, and a marker identifies the sound
source for each displayed subtitle.
